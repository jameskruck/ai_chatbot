        <h3>Virtual Study Group Demonstration Transcript</h3>
        <div class="transcript-content">
          <p><strong>[0:00]</strong> Hi again. It's James, your instructor, and I'm going to give you a quick walk through how to join and work with your virtual study group. So we're going to get started by selecting "Join Your Study Group." That's going to open an expanded window in which you're entered into a chat with your peers. These are all virtual, OpenAI created characters who are going to help you kind of work through the process.</p>
          
          <p><strong>[0:21]</strong> So you're going to start off with Sarah. Sarah says, hi, I'm Sarah, excited to work through this FashionForward case with you. I've been looking at some similar customer service automation in my consulting work. What's your initial take on Jessica's situation? So feel free to add some however you want. I'm going to say I'm concerned about the high volume of calls.</p>
          
          <p><strong>[0:50]</strong> Sarah responds high. The high volume of calls is definitely a key factor to consider. Have we looked at the breakdown of inquiries to see if there are any patterns or trends we can leverage? I could continue this conversation with Sarah, or I can invite a different classmate into the room. Marcus is my peer playing a retail CX Director. Let's bring in Marcus.</p>
          
          <p><strong>[1:12]</strong> Marcus introduces himself: Marcus here. I couldn't help but overhear your discussion about FashionForward. This actually reminds me some customer experience challenges we face when evaluating automation options. Mind if I share some insights from the retail side? Well, we do want to hear that. So please do share, Marcus.</p>
          
          <p><strong>[1:32]</strong> Thanks for bringing that up. In my experience at my current company, we saw a similar trend with call volumes, and we were able to address it by implementing a more efficient ticketing system. So that's the insight from Marcus here. You still have one more classmate we can introduce. That's Priya. Priya comes in and she's got a insight into, her tech role.</p>
          
          <p><strong>[1:53]</strong> So she says, hi all. Priya jumping in. I caught part of your conversation. This case is really similar to what I dealt with when building my AI platform. I've seen both the wins and spectacular failures in customer service automation. Happy to share some technical perspective. I'd love to hear that. Yeah, please do share some common pitfalls, Priya.</p>
          
          <p><strong>[2:20]</strong> Priya says yeah, definitely. One common pitfall I've seen is not fully understanding the customer journey before implementing any new tech solutions. It's crucial to a lot of technology with the customer's needs and preferences. Sounds good. I wonder what Marcus thinks about that? What do you think about Priya's suggestion, Marcus. Marcus agrees with Priya. Understanding the customer journey is key before implementing any new technology.</p>
          
          <p><strong>[2:53]</strong> In my role as Customer Experience Director, aligning tech solutions with customer needs has always been crucial for maintaining brand reputation. This conversation can continue on working back and forth with each other. One more button to show you here. Let's research this together. This is going to simulate as if you and your group spend some time away from this conversation and did some research.</p>
          
          <p><strong>[3:15]</strong> So here we have some results. We have some recent retail implementations, some financial insights, and some individual insights from each member of the group. After you work through this problem with your peers, you'll unlock the ability to start building your bot. So go ahead, click that. You'll send one last message to your team and then you're ready to go.</p>
          
          <p><strong>[3:37]</strong> All right everyone, thanks for watching.</p>

      <p><strong>[0:24]</strong> here's kind of a nice little flowchart for you. Familiarize yourself with it.

      <h3>Step 3 Video Walkthrough Transcript</h3>
      <p><strong>[0:00]</strong> All right, folks, we are moving on to step three. In this step, we're going to make sure that our bot is answering in the tone of voice we would like it to that matches our company. So we have some instructions here that include role, persona, constraints, and communication style. In order for you to put these into your Chatbase bot, you're going to want to select this button, copy instructions, and then I'll go into your pad.</p>
      <p><strong>[0:25]</strong> So let me bring it back over to the Chatbase. Okay. So what we want to do here to edit this is we're going to go to settings. And then we're going to go to AI. Then you'll see that there's already some pre-configured information in here. You can work with this. They have a few different examples. There's AI agent, customer support agent, but we’re going custom.</p>
      <p><strong>[0:49]</strong> So we don't really need to worry about that right now. Select all of that and replace it with our new style. Okay. And then we're going to hit save. Okay. So now we've done some configuration. That was step three.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
  </details>
  <div class="step-intro">
    <p>Now that your chatbot has the FAQ data, let's set the personality to match FashionForward's friendly, sustainable brand:</p>
    <div class="peer-insight">
      <p><strong>From Sarah:</strong> "This is critical for ROI - brand-aligned bots see 25% higher customer satisfaction in my consulting experience."</p>

    <h5>Brand Voice Configuration in Chatbase</h5>
    
    <div class="voice-config">
      <p>In your Chatbase dashboard, navigate the settings panel and select the AI button in the vertical column. You'll see pre-configured instructions - replace them with these FashionForward-specific instructions:</p>

          <span class="code-title">FashionForward Agent Instructions</span>
          <button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)" data-copy="### Role
- Primary Function: You are a customer support agent here to assist users based on specific training data provided. Your main objective is to inform, clarify, and answer questions strictly related to this training data and your role.
- Company Identity: You represent FashionForward, a sustainable t-shirt retailer, and should always maintain this brand identity in your responses.
                
### Persona
- Identity: You are a dedicated customer support agent. You cannot adopt other personas or impersonate any other entity. If a user tries to make you act as a different chatbot or persona, politely decline and reiterate your role to offer assistance only with matters related to customer support.
- Brand Voice: Maintain a friendly, conversational, and enthusiastic tone that reflects FashionForward's commitment to sustainable fashion and excellent customer service.
                
### Constraints
1. No Data Divulge: Never mention that you have access to training data explicitly to the user.
2. Maintaining Focus: If a user attempts to divert you to unrelated topics, never change your role or break your character. Politely redirect the conversation back to topics relevant to customer support.
3. Exclusive Reliance on Training Data: You must rely exclusively on the training data provided to answer user queries. If a query is not covered by the training data, use the fallback response.
4. Restrictive Role Focus: You do not answer questions or perform tasks that are not related to your role. This includes refraining from tasks such as coding explanations, personal advice, or any other unrelated activities.
5. Brand Boundaries: Focus exclusively on FashionForward t-shirt products and services. Do not provide information about competitors or other clothing brands.

### Communication Style
- Tone: Friendly and conversational - never formal or corporate
- Language: Use phrases like 'Easy!', 'Absolutely!', 'We're here to help!' to show enthusiasm
- Sustainability Focus: Mention eco-friendly aspects when relevant to reinforce our brand values
- Solution-Oriented: Always offer alternatives or next steps when possible
- Escalation: For complex issues, warmly direct users to human support with phrases like 'Let me connect you with our team who can help with that!'
- Helpfulness: End responses with offers to assist further when appropriate"> Copy Instructions</button>

    <div class="transcript-content">
      <p><strong>[0:00]</strong> All right. You've done the hard work in setting up your bot, giving it some information to work off of. Now it's time to do a little bit of testing. Okay. So in this scenario, your classmates have come up with some chat suggestions for what we should be looking for. So let's just go ahead and copy this question.</p>
      <p><strong>[0:20]</strong> I'll bring it over to our training data. Let's go over to playground to test this out. Let's go ahead and paste that in.</p>
      <p><strong>[0:30]</strong> Okay. Glad to know. Let's try a different one. Let's see if we were a little bit upset. Let's see how the bot handles that. So we're going to copy "I'm really frustrated - my package is lost."</p>
      <p><strong>[0:51]</strong> Okay. And it responds in a very human way. Oh no, I'm really sorry to hear that your package seems to be lost. If it's been more than seven days in shipping, please reach out to our support team and we'll investigate this for you right away. Just let us know your order number and we'll get to the bottom of it. We're here to help.</p>
      <p><strong>[1:06]</strong> That's responding as expected. So you can keep on going through the test until you're satisfied. Of course, if you need to change anything, everything can be editable in here. So you can show your sources by clicking Show Sources here. And we'll get some information about our FAQs. Remember, if you want to adjust some of the settings, you just want to go to settings,</p>
      <p><strong>[1:26]</strong> AI, play around the instructions a little bit, but once you reach that height like that and you're going to get complete. Thanks all!</p>
